In This folder you will find the rate of prescriptions for each county over a 4 year period.  Ideally you will find this in the main branch of our project with the paragraph below included in our main ReadMe.

One of the many dependent factors on our analysis we are hoping to include is that of the amount of opioids prescribed in each county.  The simple idea being that one major talking point of the opioid crisis in the US is that it is in part due to the number of prescription opioids used as painkillers in medicine.  These rates can be found on the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/rxrate-maps/index.html) and essentially say the number of prescriptions filled per 100 people over the course of the year.
