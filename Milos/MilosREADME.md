### Segment 1:

In this segment of our project, my role was data processing. The primary objective was to load and inspect the opioid deaths data for the years 2016 to 2020, which served as the foundation for our machine learning model. The data included information on opioid-related deaths, such as the year, county, and number of deaths, among other variables.

I started by loading the individual datasets for each year and performed an initial inspection to understand the structure and contents of the data. This step allowed me to identify any inconsistencies, missing values, or discrepancies in the data that needed to be addressed before merging the datasets.

After inspecting the data, I proceeded to merge the individual datasets for each year into a single, consolidated dataframe. This new dataframe provided a comprehensive view of opioid deaths across all the years of interest, making it easier to analyze trends and patterns over time.

To ensure the quality and integrity of the data, I performed a thorough cleaning process on the merged dataframe. This involved dealing with missing values, transforming data types, and standardizing the format of columns where necessary. This step was vital in preparing the data for integration with the rest of the team's data and making it suitable for use in a machine learning model.

Segment 1 focused on loading, inspecting, merging, and cleaning the opioid deaths data for the years 2016 to 2020. This laid the foundation for the project, allowing the team to proceed with loading the data into a database and using it to train and validate a machine learning model that can address the project's research questions.


### Segment 2: Our Plan for the Machine Learning Model

In this segment of our project, we plan to develop a machine learning model to predict total overdose deaths based on a set of socioeconomic and demographic factors. The dataset includes features such as population, education, unemployment, poverty, income, and dispensing rate, which will be used as predictors for the target variable, total overdose deaths.

To accomplish this, we will first import the necessary libraries, such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. We will then load our dataset and preprocess it by handling missing values, dropping unnecessary columns, and performing any other required data cleaning steps.

Next, we will create the feature matrix (X) and the target vector (y) by selecting the appropriate columns from the dataset. The data will then be split into training and test sets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for testing.

To ensure that our machine learning models can effectively learn from the data, we will scale the features using StandardScaler from scikit-learn. This will help normalize the data and make it suitable for training.

We plan to explore two different machine learning algorithms for this task: a neural network (MLPRegressor) and a random forest (RandomForestRegressor). We will train both models on the training data and make predictions on the test data. The performance of each model will be evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and R2 score.

After evaluating both models, we will compare their performance and choose the best one based on the evaluation metrics. If necessary, we can also explore incorporating other models, such as those that utilize confusion matrices for evaluation, to further improve our predictions and potentially gain additional insights.

By following this plan, we hope to create a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict total overdose deaths based on the socioeconomic and demographic factors provided in our dataset.


### Data Disclaimer and Compliance

Our team is committed to ensuring the responsible and ethical use of data in our research and analysis. In the development of our machine learning model for predicting opioid overdose deaths, we have used data obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), a reputable source that adheres to strict data privacy regulations.

In accordance with the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 242m(d)), our team has taken the necessary precautions to abide by the data use restrictions outlined by NCHS. We understand the importance of protecting the privacy of individuals and establishments represented in the data, and we are committed to using the data solely for health statistical reporting and analysis.

To comply with these restrictions, we have:

* Used the data exclusively for health statistical reporting and analysis in the context of our project.
* Ensured that any sub-national geographic data presented or published does not include death counts of 9 or fewer, or death rates based on counts of nine or fewer.
* Made no attempts to discover the identity of any person or establishment included in the data.
* Committed to reporting any inadvertent discoveries of personal or establishment identities to the NCHS Confidentiality Officer, and refraining from disclosing or using such information.
While these data use restrictions may impose certain limitations on our analysis, we are confident in our ability to develop a reliable machine learning model that can provide valuable insights into the factors influencing opioid overdose deaths. By adhering to these guidelines, our team aims to maintain the highest standards of ethical research and analysis, while ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of individuals and establishments represented in the data.
